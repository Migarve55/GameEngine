# GameEngine
Game engine using OpenGL and java. This project is based in the tutorials of the "thin matrix" youtube channel.

Be sure to use OpenGL 4.0, and start from Eclipse.
If you have other version of OpenGL, try to change "#version 400" in both vertex and fragment shader text files, in the package "shaders", to you own version. For example, OpenGL 1.5 will be "#version 150". Also, you may have to change some of the syntax to fit the version of GLSL. For instance, "texture()" in V4.0 in V1.5 is "texture2D()". Check the shaders compiler error for more information.
